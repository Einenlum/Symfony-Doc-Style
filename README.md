Symfony Doc: Enhanced Syntax Highlighting Anytime
=================

A [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/stylish/) theme for Symfony Documentation. 

This style has two purposes:

First, it changes most of the colors to make the it all look better and be more accessible (comments are by default in a difficult to read color). It also highlights some parts of the code (some internal PHP functions for example) which are not highlighted by default.

Second and more important, it allows to keep the syntax highlighting on the website even when using a global stylish theme (like [Solarized Dark Everywhere](http://userstyles.org/styles/98305/solarized-dark-everywhere)) that removes by default all these colors.

The code is commented, so you can easily change the color values you donâ€™t like.
